Welcome to FLOCK, Casper WY's new go-to spot for all things crispy and delicious! I'm Trent Bradfield, and I created FLOCK with one simple goal: to serve up the best chicken tenders in town; fresh and packed with flavor. We take pride in marinating and breading our chicken in-house, while crafting our sauces and desserts from scratch to keep things fresh and tasty. Whether you're here for a quick bite or a hearty meal, we've got you covered with mouthwatering food that'll leave you wanting to come back for more. Join us at FLOCK, where comfort food and good vibes are always on the menu!
